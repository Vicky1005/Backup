[Verse 1]
Chill out, whatcha yelling for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be, you would see
I like you the way you are
When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talkin' to me one-on-one
But you become

[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get
And you turn it into honesty
And promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no
